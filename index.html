                            A proprietary platform for OpenWeb (formerly Spot.IM). The mission was to build a complete infrastructure for ingesting, tagging, and moderating millions of pieces of user generated content per minute across all of the OpenWeb platform. The project was build with high scale, reliability, and efficiency in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project was built using an event sourced architecture with several microservices managing different parts of the system. It was written in Go, utilizing SQS and Kafka as event queues, and deployed on Kubernetes. After the creation of the system, a case study was done with Google's Jigsaw team on the effect of nudges and real-time moderation on users.

It expanded a lot as I learned how the entire HTTP protocol worked, and I am currently working on expanding it into a complete webserver.

                                A proprietary classification algorithm for Signals Analytics.
