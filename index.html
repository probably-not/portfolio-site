                        I am an American-Israeli software developer and entrepreneur. I grew up in Herzliya, Israel, and moved to the USA with my family in 2003. I started programming at the young age of 11, doing projects that I thought were cool, and soon realized my love for all things technology. As I matured, I decided to pursue a career in the field I loved, and focused on learning as much as I could about programming and software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating high school, I studied for a year at the Engineering School of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, focusing on Computer Science. After studying at UIUC for a year, I began working in Atlanta for various companies, writing software and algorithms as an independent software developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an independent developer, I have gotten a lot of experience working in small, medium, and large businesses, doing any sort of development that the companies need. I specializes in development, efficiency, and breaking things down in order to fix them and make them work better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I moved back to Israel in 2016 and started working as a software developer soon after arriving here. As a software developer, I've learned to design architectures, create services in various languages, and help companies scale to the next level.

                            A proprietary platform for OpenWeb (formerly Spot.IM). The mission was to build a complete infrastructure for ingesting, tagging, and moderating millions of pieces of user generated content per minute across all of the OpenWeb platform. The project was build with high scale, reliability, and efficiency in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project was built using an event sourced architecture with several microservices managing different parts of the system. It was written in Go, utilizing SQS and Kafka as event queues, and deployed on Kubernetes. After the creation of the system, a case study was done with Google's Jigsaw team on the effect of nudges and real-time moderation on users.

It expanded a lot as I learned how the entire HTTP protocol worked, and I am currently working on expanding it into a complete webserver.

                                A proprietary classification algorithm for Signals Analytics.
